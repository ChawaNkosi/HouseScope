üè† HouseScope: The Real Affordability Calculator (FNB Hackathon 2025 Submission)
üë§ Solo Development Effort
HouseScope was conceptualized, designed, and developed entirely by one person, Chawanangwa Nkosi . This highlights the commitment and efficiency in delivering a fully functional, impactful application within the hackathon timeframe.

üèÜ FNB App of the Year Hackathon Project
HouseScope is a comprehensive home affordability calculator designed specifically for South African first-time buyers. It goes beyond standard bond calculations to factor in all hidden monthly costs (rates, levies, insurance) and uses a powerful Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio analysis to give users a truly realistic budget and a clear "Path to Affordability."

üì∏ Screenshots & Visual Demo
This section showcases the key features and user interface of the HouseScope calculator.

üíî The Problem HouseScope Solves
Most existing mortgage affordability tools are fundamentally flawed because they only calculate the principal and interest repayment. This leaves first-time buyers shocked by unexpected monthly costs.

Incomplete Picture: Buyers only see the bond repayment and ignore the R3,000 - R5,000 in estimated monthly rates, taxes, and levies.

Loan Rejection Risk: Buyers often apply for bonds they cannot afford because their actual Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio is too high after factoring in all costs, leading to high rejection rates.

üöÄ Key Features
Full Cost Breakdown: Calculates Total Monthly Repayment including estimated rates, taxes, insurance, and levies based on the property's location and value.

Critical DTI Analysis: Instantly calculates the user's Debt-to-Income ratio and provides a clear Affordability Status (e.g., "Critical: DTI Too High" or "Highly Affordable").

Path to Affordability: If the DTI is too high, the app suggests concrete actions: the exact amount by which to reduce monthly debt/expenses OR increase monthly income.

FLISP Subsidy Check: Direct guidance for properties under R600k and incomes under R22k/month.

PDF Report Generation: Users can download a full, detailed affordability report using jsPDF.

‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack
HouseScope was built rapidly using modern, front-end technologies to ensure speed, privacy, and accessibility.

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

Data Visualization: Chart.js (for the Bond Breakdown chart)

Reporting: jsPDF (for generating and downloading the affordability report)

Design: Fully responsive and mobile-friendly UI.

Deployment: GitHub Pages (used for the live demo)
